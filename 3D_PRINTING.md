Here is some advice on printing the shell.

# 1. Get the model
[This stl file](3D_Models/Screen_Shell.stl) of the shell uses the default settings.
If you want to tweak the model you can do that with the customizer on [the Thingiverse page](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7061084)(currently broken).
The other option is to open [Screen_Shell.scad](3D_Models/Screen_Shell.scad) in [OpenScad](https://openscad.org/) and use the customiser there.

# 2. The Filament
I used the pla filement ["Schimmernde Nacht"](https://www.recyclingfabrik.com/products/schimmernde-nacht) from Recycling Fabrik since it is close to the gunmetal color used by BueBrixx.

# 3. Print settings
I used the following settings to print my model:
- Layer Height: 0.2mm
- Infill: 15%
- Support: Organic
Optional:
- Top/Botton-Fill_Pattern: Concentric
