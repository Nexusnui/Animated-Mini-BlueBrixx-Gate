This is the guide for assembling the gate.

# 1. Insert the SD Card
Insert the sd card you prepared in the [Flashing](FLASH_FIRMWARE.md) or [Compiling](COMPILE_FIRMWARE.md) instructions.

# 2. Insert the screen into the shell
Be carefull with the sd card. 
If you use the speaker or pin-breakout(they are currently not used in this project) pull them through the gap on the side of the shell and plug them into the screen.
Insert the screen into the shell from the top, the usb c port should point towards the gap on the side.

# 3. Screw in the screen
Flip the screen and use 3x m2 screws to mount the screen the shell.
You can now remove the foil on the screen, if it is still on there.

Add the 4x stargate tiles to the front and 2x round tiles with bar(20482) to the holes next to the qap on the side.
