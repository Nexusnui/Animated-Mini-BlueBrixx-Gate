- The code uses a modified version of the [Gif viewer example(GIFDEC)](https://github.com/moononournation/Arduino_GFX/tree/master/examples/ImgViewer/ImgViewerAnimatedGIF_GIFDEC) from the [Arduino GFX library](https://github.com/moononournation/Arduino_GFX).
- The animtation was created based the one provided by David Gian-Cursion in [this blogpost](https://www.gian-cursio.net/2025/02/mr-stargate-puddle/). The current version has a blue tint and an alternative with the original colors will be provided later.
- The arduino sketch also includes some driver files from the demo provided on the [waveshare wiki](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-LCD-1.85#Resources). I am not sure under what license they are provided, if you know any better or are from waveshare inform me and I will update this project accordingly.
